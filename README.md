# Licence

There are some part from following works. They have public licenses.

1. For interacting with pipes.
   [UCI Analayzer](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/uci-analyser/)
   I want to change code there. It is to c-ish.
2. [C++ Wrapper for Standard UNIX Functions](https://www.mrochkind.com/aup/ex/group__Ux.html) I add some routines from this wrapper to the project. It is not too essential to keep.
